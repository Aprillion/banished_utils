Utilities and scripts for improving gameplay in Banished

## [banished_drag_to_move_map.ahk](banished_drag_to_move_map.ahk)
[AutoHotkey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoHotkey) script that converts mouse right-button drag movements into appropriate `W` `A` `S` `D` key presses.

E.g. when you drag the map to the right, `A` key is pressed, so the same object stays under your mouse pointer (more or less).

The simulation is not perfect and tweaking of the variables is needed for optimal performance on different systems (the default values work on my computer).
